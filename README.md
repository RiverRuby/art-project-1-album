# Album Wall Art

My first stab at computational art -- a piece for my wall. I just want to throw a bunch of random computational tools at a single problem: make a cool piece of art that involves all the albums I've listened to this year. I'm thinking CNNs, graph algorithms, GANs for style transfer, everything.

## Steps

1. Import images of album covers from a list of (album names, artist) pairs.
  - Use Google Image API and python
